## Descrpition
Was given complete Horiseon website to evaluate and optimize. steps taken to optimize website included making the site more accessable through alt text, replaced divs and added more semantic HTML elements, decreased the repetition of CSS selectors. After completion of this task I learned that code can always be improved for users through accessibility and developers through a more oragnized and easier to understand structure.
